=====================================

Whenever a component on pear.php.net triggers a write operation on the
database or on other storage resources, the change has to be logged, in
order to allow tracking changes or abuse.

Usually the log message will go to syslog(3). Additionally it may make
sense in some situations to additionally generate an email containing
the log message.

Pear.php.net does offer the Damblan namespace Damblan_Log_* for
this, which is derived from PEAR::Log. Every component must use
Damblan_Log_* for logging!
