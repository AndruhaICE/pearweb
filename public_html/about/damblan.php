<h1>Damblan</h1>

<p>Damblan is a set of utility classes, which we are using on
pear.php.net. Some people might even call Damblan a framework, but we
don&#39;t. For now.</p>

<p>The name is derived from the Nepalese summit
<a href="http://www.summitpost.com/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/52">Ama Dablam</a>
but with an additional &quot;m&quot;. Please do not ask for the reason.</p>

<p>Currently the feature set of Damblan is quite limited, but we are
working towards integrating more great stuff. At a certain point there
may be even the possibility to download and install Damblan as a PEAR 
package.</p>

<p>If you have questions or comments about Damblan, get in touch with
<a href="/user/mj/">Martin</a>. The bleeding edge version of Damblan is 
<a href="http://cvs.php.net/cvs.php/pearweb/include/Damblan">available via CVS</a>.
