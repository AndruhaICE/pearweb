<h1>The first democratically elected PEAR Group has taken power</h1>

[May 4, 2007]

<div style="margin-left:2em;margin-right:2em">
<p>
For the first time in its history, PEAR has a new PEAR Group.  Following on the
heels of the adoption of the <a href="/manual/en/constitution.php">Constitution</a>,
the new members have been elected by secret ballot of
the PEAR developers and they have chosen:
 <ul>
  <li>
    Martin Jansen
  </li>
  <li>
    David Coallier
  </li>
  <li>
    Arnaud Limbourg
  </li>
  <li>
    Joshua Eichorn
  </li>
  <li>
    Christian Weiske
  </li>
  <li>
    Helgi &THORN;ormar
  </li>
 </ul>
</p>
<p>
 The PEAR Group members will serve a term from May 1, 2007 until May 1, 2008.
</p>
<p>
 The election results are <a href="/election/info.php?election=7&results=1">here</a>.
 There was a tie for the 7th slot, and <a href="/user/lsmith">Lukas Smith</a> has been
 appointed by the president, <a href="/user/cellog">Gregory Beaver</a> to temporarily
 act as the 7th PEAR Group member until <a href="/election/info.php?election=9&vote=1">the
 run-off election</a> can be held.
</p>
<p>
