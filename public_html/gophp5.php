<h2>Joining the GoPHP5.org's movement</h2>
<p>
After being the leader and most use PHP applications and libraries
for many years with over 30 Million downloads, the 
<a href="http://pear.php.net">PEAR Project</a> is happy to announce
that the next version of PEAR, named PEAR2, is going to aim at being
only available for PHP5.2 and newer versions of <a href="http://php.net">PHP</a>
</p>

<p>
PEAR2 is currently not released but under development with a new installer (Pyrus)
coming along the way. Using the benefits of the PHP Archiver (<a href="http://pecl.php.net/phar">PHAR</a>)
and the features that PHP5.2 offers, we can now produce better applications than
ever using the PHP language.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to all our users and especially our dedicated developers for making this possible. Without them, we would not be able
to achieve and reach a goal that has been important to us for the few past years, moving to PHP5.
