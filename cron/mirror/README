Mirroring pear.php.net
======================

In order to mirror the REST files and download tgz files,
the scripts in this directory must be placed on the mirror
server.  Here are the configuration steps

1) The Mirror's IP must be registered at pear.php.net as
   a valid mirror
2) The Mirror must be registered as a DNS alias in the form
   xx.pear.php.net (us.pear.php.net, de.pear.php.net, etc.)
3) The existing scripts assume that user "pear" is created
   and that mirror scripts go in /home/pear/pear.php.net/.
   Change this path in the pear.php.net.mirror script if this
   is incorrect.
4) Update the mirror alias in mirrorupdate.php
5) set up a cron job every 4 hours to run pear.php.net.mirror
6) set up download_stats.php to be only allowed access from IP
   216.92.131.66 (pear.php.net), and change the path to the log
   file at the top

That's it!
