DEVELOPER'S GUIDE FOR ``pearweb´´ CODE
========================================================================

$Id$

Read this before starting to hack on the PEAR website.

1) Coding Standards
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Code for the PEAR website strictly follows the PEAR Coding Standards 
    [1].

    If changes that do not follow these standards are committed to the 
    repository, they will be reverted.

2) Only commit working code
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    People constantly committing code that makes (parts of) the website 
    unaccessable will loose their CVS karma.

    Test your changes before committing them.  If you are unable to set 
    up a test environment, you must not commit anything!


3) Usage of header comment blocks
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Every newly added text file has to carry a header comment block
    similar to the following:

    /*
       +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
       | PEAR Web site version 1.0                                            |
       +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
       | Copyright (c) 2005 The PEAR Group                                    |

4) Performance
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The PEAR website can be considered a high traffic website, which is
    why a content cache is employed.  If new sections/pages are added, 
    one has to make sure that they get cached if it makes sense.  (Most
    of the time it makes sense.)

    Also one has to ensure that newly added code does not lead to 
    performance issues or bottlenecks.

5) Dependencies
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If new dependencies are introduced, they must be written down in
    pearweb/package.xml.

    If possible, non-PEAR dependencies and dependencies on packages with
    only beta- or alpha-releases must be avoided.

6) Talk first, code later
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If you want to implement new features, ask the PEAR webmaster team 
    [2] first.  Otherwise you may run into serious trouble.
